## TODO

This is pretty much the first project I've ever written in rust so I
think there are a lot of things that could be improved upon.

Except for all the mistakes I have inevitably made there are some definitely
improvements that can be made to the testing of all the functionality.

Especially introducing some fuzzing or property testing framework would make it magnitudes 
better.
